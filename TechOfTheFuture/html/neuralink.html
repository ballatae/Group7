    <div class="ai-contenttxt"><h4>Neuralink</h4> 
            <p> Elon Musk is well-known for his high-profile businesses such as Tesla and SpaceX, but he also has a few strange endeavors. He claims that by using one of them, he was able to accomplish "symbiosis" between the human brain and artificial intelligence.
                Musk's brain interface technology firm is called Neuralink. The business is developing a gadget that might be implanted in a person's brain and used to both record and stimulate brain activity. The gadget has been equated to a "FitBit in your head" by Musk. While Musk loves to talk about his futuristic vision for the technology, it has a lot of potential medical uses in the near future.

    <div class="ai-contenttxt"><h4>The origins</h4> 
            <p> The existence of Neuralink was first made public in 2017, when the Wall Street Journal reported on it. The company's first significant public appearance was in 2019, when Elon Musk and other members of the management team gave a livestreamed presentation showcasing Neuralink's concepts. Two pieces of equipment are being developed by Neuralink. The first is a chip that is implanted in a person's skull and has electrodes that fan out into their brain.Neuralink is working on a chip the size of a cent that would be implanted in a patient's skull. An array of tiny wires, each about 20 times thinner than a human hair, spread out from the chip and into the patient's brain. The wires are fitted with 1,024 electrodes that can monitor brain activity as well as electrically stimulate the brain in theory. This information is wirelessly relayed to computers, where it may be analyzed by researchers.The second is a robot that could implant the chip autonomously.
                The robot would function by punching flexible wires from a Neuralink chip into a person's brain with a stiff needle, similar to a sewing machine. In January 2021, Neuralink produced a video displaying the robot. The gadget, according to Musk, may make implanting Neuralink's electrodes as simple as LASIK eye surgery. While this is a big assertion, neuroscientists told Insider in 2019 that the gadget has a lot of promise. Professor Andrew Hires emphasized function that would automatically alter the needle to accommodate for a patient's brain movement during surgery, since the brain movements along with respiration and heartbeat. The robot is presently eight feet tall, and its design was created by Woke Studios while Neuralink develops its underlying technology.

        <h4>First demonstration</h4> 
        <p> During a live demonstration in 2020, the business demonstrated one of its chips in a pig named Gertrude. The proof-of-concept demonstration revealed how the chip could precisely anticipate Gertrude's limb positions while walking on a treadmill, as well as capture brain activity when the pig sniffed about for food. The pig had been living with the chip implanted in her skull for two months, according to Musk.</p>

        <h4>Monkey demonstration</h4>
        <p>Pager, a macaque monkey, was filmed playing video games like "Pong" for banana smoothie prizes, according to Neuralink. Pager used a joystick that was not linked to the console to play the games, which meant he was directing the cursor with his brain impulses as his arm moved. Elon Musk boasts that Neuralink can allow monkeys to control computers via their brain waves, but neuroscientists are skeptical.</p>

        <h4>Is this ground-breaking technology?</h4>
        <p>"All the technology that he showed has been already developed in some way or form, [...] Essentially what they've done is just package it into a nice little form that then sends data wirelessly," Dr. Jason Shepherd, an associate professor of neurobiology at the University of Utah, told Insider following the 2020 demonstration. "If you just watched this presentation, you would think that it's coming out of nowhere, that Musk is doing this magic, but in reality, he's really copied and pasted a lot of work from many, many labs that have been working on this," he added.</p>
