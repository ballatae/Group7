    <div class="ai-contenttxt"><h4>Immersive Shopping</h4>
        <p>Virtual reality is already being utilized to improve shopping experiences. Virtual reality allows buyers to try on clothing or test drive a car in a virtual environment before making a purchase; for example, they may try on apparel or test drive a car. While virtual shopping is amazing, artificial intelligence will make it even better.

                A customer interested in purchasing furniture, for example, may use VR to try out different sofas and chairs, while AI can introduce a virtual sales associate who can offer recommendations, answer questions, and even finalize a sale. The confluence of AI and VR helps not just consumers, but also businesses. For example, it will allow businesses to learn more about their customers, such as what they enjoy and how they purchase, in order to enhance their products and increase sales.</p>

        <div class="ai-panel"> <p>Store robotization is bound to lower queues and the number of personnel while also saving money on operating costs. Checkout-free stores have already been implemented by Amazon AI. When you take anything from the shelf or put it back, the Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping system reacts. When you leave the store with your purchases, your Amazon account will debit your account. Amazon intends to open additional AI-powered stores, such as Amazon Go, where just six to twenty human employees are required.

        <div class="ai-panel"> <p>AI chatbots improve customer service by optimizing search, providing announcements about new collections, and recommending merchandise. If an user has previously purchased a dress, a chatbot can propose a fancy belt to complete the outfit. Eighty percent of companies across the world are now utilizing AI chatbots or plan to do so in the near future. To assist its clients in navigating their collections, Tommy Hilfiger and Burberry have created chatbots.

        <div class="ai-panel"><p>Retailers also invest in technology that assist customers and store employees throughout the shopping experience. Kroger Edge technology has replaced paper price tags with smart shelf tags in their shops. On the screens, this technology also gives video commercials, nutritional information, and promotions. Lowebot, a Lowe's autonomous in-store robot, assists consumers in finding what they need in the shop in a variety of languages. At the same time, owing to real-time monitoring features, it aids inventory management.

        <div class="ai-panel"><p>AI applications in retail outlets might aid in the pricing of items by showing the anticipated results of various pricing schemes. Systems collect information on other items, promotional efforts, sales numbers, and other data in order to carry out this task. Business owners can promote the ideal deals to attract new clients and increase profits. eBay and Kroger both use Artificial Intelligence to optimize their pricing and remain flexible in their capacity to modify rates and promotions based on the data they collect.</p>

        <div class="ai-panel"><p>The price of a product is estimated based on demand, trends, features, the release date of latest versions of the same item, as well as other aspects. Its most obvious application is in the travel business, but it might also be utilized in retail. Consider an app or platform that enables your users to see how the cost of a good will change in advance. This is doable and simple to accomplish using Artificial Intelligence. A price prediction function may aid in client retention. But, in the retail industry, predictive analytics and machine learning may very well do much more than just a cost estimate.</p>

        <button class="ai-accordion"><h4>6. Logistics and supply chain management</h4></button>
            <div class="ai-panel"><p>Every year, merchants lose over $1.1 trillion due to poor execution in this sector. It is possible to avoid leftovers and out-of-stock situations. In the retail supply chain, AI may be used for restocking, which involves assessing demand for a certain product based on past sales, location, weather, trends, promotions, and other factors. With the aid of BlueYonder, Morrisons improved their stock forecasting and restocking in 491 shops. It led to a decline of up to 30% in in-store shelf gaps.</p>

        <button class="ai-accordion"><h4>7. Product classification via machine learning in retail</h4></button>
        <div class="ai-panel"><p>LovetheSales.com is an excellent example of Machine Learning in the Retail Industry, since it employs Machine Learning Models to categorize over a million goods from a variety of merchants. Machine Learning-based systems tag items and arrange them into distinct categories for clients looking for a certain type of product. Lalafo vendors may just submit an image of the things they wish to sell, and computer vision-based Machine Learning retail software can detect, categorize, and even propose a price. Using Machine Learning Models, this platform already handles over 900 requests per second, increasing sales with relevant information.</p>

            <div class="ai-panel"><p>Visual Search systems powered by Artificial Intelligence allow customers to upload images and find similar products based on colors, shapes, and patterns. Image recognition technology from Cortexica promises close to 95% accuracy. Customers approved The Find Similar feature with 90% positive feedback. The IR technology of American Eagle uses Visual Search — which not only helps people get the same or similar clothes but also suggests what would go well with it.

            <div class="ai-panel"><p>Walmart, Tesco, Kohl's, Costco, and a slew of other major retailers employ Google or Amazon AI to provide customers an easy and rapid voice search experience. Customers may now ask Alexa for the item they want and the status of its delivery without having to type anything. In reality, voice search on mobile is used by 27% of people globally, and 52% prefer it over mobile applications and websites because it is more convenient.</p>

            <div class="ai-panel"><p>This is another another fantastic application worth mentioning. Customers may save time and find the right combination with all the items ideally matched in a couple of minutes using virtual fitting rooms. In 20 seconds, a virtual fitting kiosk from Me-Ality can scan you and measure 200,000 points on your body. Companies such as Levi's, Gap, and others placed these scanners in their stores and saw a significant rise in sales.</p>

            <div class="ai-panel"><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can identify your clients' moods during the purchase process. For this purpose, Walmart has already implemented a facial recognition technology. Each checkout line has cameras mounted, and if a client is irritated, a business worker will speak with him or her. Mood tracking will undoubtedly aid in the development of better client connections.</p>
