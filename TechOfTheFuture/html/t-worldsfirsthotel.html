                       Space Travel Era is just arourd the corner 
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="t-paragraph">
                    Back in 2019, Californian company the Gateway Foundation released plans for a cruise ship-style hotel that could one day float above the Earth's atmosphere.
                        <br><br>
                    Then called the Von Braun Station, this futuristic concept was scheduled to be fully operational by 2027.
                    Fast forward a couple years and the hotel has a new name -- Voyager Station -- and it's set to be built by Orbital Assembly Corporation, a new construction company run by former pilot John Blincow, who also heads up the Gateway Foundation.
                        <br><br>
                    "We're trying to make the public realize that this golden age of space travel is just around the corner. It's coming. It's coming fast," said Blincow.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="../images/firsthotel2.jpg" class="t-leftimage">
                <div class="t-subcontent">
                    <h3>
                        A hotel like no other
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="t-paragraph">
                        Renderings of what the hotel might look like suggest an interior not dissimilar to a luxury Earth-bound hotel, just with some pretty spectacular out-of-this-world views.
                        <br><br>
                        When the initial designs premiered a couple years ago, Tim Alatorre, senior design architect at Orbital Assembly Corporation told CNN Travel the hotel's aesthetic was a direct response to the Stanley Kubrick movie "2001: A Space Odyssey" -- which he called "almost a blueprint of what not to do."
                        <br><br>
                        "I think the goal of Stanley Kubrick was to highlight the divide between technology and humanity and so, purposefully, he made the stations and the ships very sterile and clean and alien."
                        <br><br>
                        Instead, Alatorre and his team want to bring a slice of earth to space via warm suites and chic bars and restaurants. Guests might be in space, but they can still enjoy regular beds and showers.

                    <h3>
                        How does it work?
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="t-paragraph">
                    Alatorre told CNN Travel that the rotating wheel would work to create a simulated gravity.
                    <br><br>
                    "The station rotates, pushing the contents of the station out to the perimeter of the station, much in the way that you can spin a bucket of water -- the water pushes out into the bucket and stays in place," he said.
                    <br><br>
                    Near the center of the station there's no artificial gravity, Alatorre explained, but as you move down the outside of the station, the feeling of gravity increases.

                    While Voyager Station is perhaps the flashiest of Orbital's designs, it's actually just one facet of their space ambitions.
                    <br><br>
                    The team is also hoping to build research stations, and spark space tourism and commerce opportunities.
                    <br><br>
                    "We're designing the tools and machines right now that can build these structures very quickly," Blincow told CNN Travel.
                    <br><br>
                    The team imagine government or private companies might use modules for training crews "heading to Mars, the Moon and beyond," as Alatorre outlined at the 2021 live event.
                    <br><br>
                    The next stage in getting the Voyager Station off the ground is bringing more investors into the mix, and continuing with tests on the ground.
